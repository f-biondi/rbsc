# Scaling Weisfeiler–Leman Expressiveness Analysis

Experiments code for the paper "Scaling Weisfeiler–Leman Expressiveness Analysis to Massive Graphs with GPUs". the datasets flickr, yelp, reddit and all of the datasets for the SR multicore implementation are not included for space limitations while datasets from the LAW collection are downloaded at runtime by the test scripts.

# Requirements
- CUDA version >= 12.8 (a device with compute capability >=9 is required) 
- Cmake version >= 3.16
- g++
- python3
- cargo (to compile [webgraph-rs](https://github.com/vigna/webgraph-rs), used to decompress the LAW datasets)
- sqlite3 (to read results)
  
# Installation
Run 
`./install.sh`
# Running normal tests
Run `python3 bench.py number_of_gpus_to_be_used`  
experiment times will be saved in the results table of the `bench.db` sqlite3 database. Each row corresponds to one dataset and have the following fields:

- **name** name of the dataset
- **tool** name of the tool to use for the decompression of the dataset
- **nodes** number of nodes of the dataset
- **edges** number of edges of the dataset
- **cpu** result of the RSC CPU implementation
- **valmari** result of the partition refinement CPU implementation
- **mc_xx** results for the SR implementation (ignored since datasets are not present for space limitations)
- **cuda** result of the GPU RBSC implementation with a batch size of 100%
- **cuda_xx** result of the GPU RBSC implementation with a batch size of xx%
- **status** has a value of 1 if all the experiments on this dataset have been completed

results for each of the implementations is saved as a JSON object having the following keys:

- **nodes** number of nodes of the resulting graph, if the experiment have not been completed successfully (e.g. timeout) this field have a value of 0
- **time** runtime in seconds of the experiment capped at the timeout time
- **done** is equal to 1 if the result is the coarsest possible BE reduction of the original graph otherwise equal to 0
  
# Running large scale tests
Run `python3 benchlarge.py number_of_gpus_to_be_used edge_batch_size`  
experiment times will be saved in the results table of the `benchlarge.db` sqlite3 database. Each row corresponds to one dataset and have the following fields:

- **name** name of the dataset
- **tool** name of the tool to use for the decompression of the dataset
- **nodes** number of nodes of the dataset
- **edges** number of edges of the dataset
- **cpu** result of the RSC CPU implementation
- **valmari** result of the partition refinement CPU implementation
- **cuda** result of the GPU RBSC implementation with selected batch size
- **status** has a value of 1 if all the experiments on this dataset have been completed

results for each of the implementations are saved in the same way of the ones of the normal tests.
